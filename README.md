To Predict the salary of employee based on the information provided in the dataset. Performed EDA, preprocessing, build different models, visualized feature importance, did hyper parameter tunning of each model and did prediction.

Conclusion:
According to this model, the predicted value we got, matches with the actual target values. Does the model is performing well. Even though we use only 50000 samples, the model may perform much better when trained on complete dataset.
